<h3>Brief Intro</h3>
<p>
    I am a second-year Computer Science student at Sheffield Hallam University currently looking for a placement between
    my second and third years.
</p>
<h3>Why I studied Computer Science</h3>
<p>
    I have been interested in information technologies from an early age. I knew I wanted to study in the broad area of
    information technology as it would enable me to pursue a career in an area I greatly enjoy.
</p>
<p>
    I chose to study for a degree in Computer Science degree in particular as it provides me with a wide set of skills
    and knowledge which form the foundation for many systems and technologies. The broad knowledge I gained would allow
    me to specialise as required at a future date.
</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p> I have a variety of interests. These include:</p>
<h4>Outdoor activities</h4>
<p>
    I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and camping. While at university I try to walk as often as I can, walking
    in the peak district.
</p>
<p>
    I was part of a Gateshead Scout Group from when I was in primary school till sixth form, where I learned how to
    navigate by a map and compass, kayaking, survival skills and how to teach these skills to younger members of the
    group. While I was there, I also successfully completed the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award.
</p>
<h4>Computers in general</h4>
<p>
    I am interested in computers and technology in general beyond what I study at University. I am always keen to find
    out how things work. For example, when I get a new piece of technology I enjoy dissembling it and looking at how it
    is put together and functions. This is also true for software services: I enjoy finding out how the software
    interacts with other software systems or the hardware it's running on. Outside of Uni, I also like to do projects of
    my own, for example, I am currently learning how to program in OpenGL, and in the past, I have used a Raspberry Pi
    and Arduino to do tasks.
</p>
<h4>Violin</h4>
<p>
    I have played the violin since I was in Year 4. I have played in solos and orchestras. Currently, I enjoy learning
    new tunes and practising when I get free time from my studies and other commitments.
