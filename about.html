<h3>Brief Intro</h3>
<p>I was born in the city of Gateshead which is just south of the River Tyne in the North East of England. I still live in my first house with my Mam, Dad and younger brother. Being just under the Tyne is quite useful as it means I can just get a twenty minute bus and I’m in the City centre of Newcastle which is great for going out with my friends.</p>
		<p>I went to Lord Lawson of Beamish Academy in a town called Birtley for my secondary school education and then stayed on to Sixth Form where I studied Maths, Physics and IT BTEC.</p>
		<p> whilst at Sixth Form I decided to go to Sheffield Hallam University because Sheffield as a city seemed like a nice place with the Uni being right in the city centre and the Course seemed the better compared to the other University’s that I went to for the open days.</p>
