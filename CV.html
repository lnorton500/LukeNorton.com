<h3>Skills</h3>
<div class="subSection">
    <h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>I have been programming since I was 14 years old for my Computer Science GCSE, where I learnt Python. Since then,
        through my University Programming Modules, I have expanded my knowledge of computer languages to include C++,
        Java,
        C# and JavaScript. I have studied how to write cleaner and more efficient code. I have also learnt different
        coding
        techniques in my object-orientated module.</p>

    <h4>Working in a Group</h4>
    <p>I have extensive experience in team working and this is something I enjoy. Three out of the six modules I studied
        in
        the first year of my degree course required me to successfully complete group assignments. In my Group
        Development
        Project this year, I will be given a task from a real-life industry client that I, with a group of three other
        students, will need to complete. Before commencing my studies in Sheffield, I successfully completed my Duke of
        Edinburgh Silver Expedition. This required me to work with my expedition team to complete a 3-day 45km hike.
    </p>

    <h4>Web development</h4>
    <p>I have experience in web development in multiple different settings. In my first year at university, I have had
        multiple assignments focused on web development also I am currently in the process of creating my own
        self-promotional website. During my placement at RIBA, I gained experience in web development in the workplace.
        I
        worked with the RIBA website development team where at that time they were updating their website. As a result,
        I
        gained valuable hands-on experience in how a company implements development stages.</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<div class="subSection">
    <p>I enjoy camping and hiking and was in the Scouts for 10 years before I came to University. While an Explorer
        Scout, I
        gained my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award. This involved completing a 20-mile expedition over 2 days,
        volunteering
        and developing new skills; for example, I learned how to kayak, which I particularly enjoyed. I am now working
        towards finishing my Silver Duke of Edinburgh Award having completed my expedition.</p>

    <p>I especially enjoy working with computers and I am interested in many aspects of computer science. This is why I
        decided to study for a Computer Science degree, and I plan to make my career in this area. In my spare time, I
        have
        carried out various computing and programming projects. Examples of the programming activities I have done
        include
        teaching myself Open GL.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy playing the violin, having achieved Grade 4. I have played in solo and orchestra performances at my
        school and with other groups.</p>
